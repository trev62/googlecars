        <p class="summary">On May 28th, 2014, Google presented a prototype of a driverless car that had 
        no steering wheel or pedals. There were four states at the time that allowed 
        driverless cars public road testing. One of which was California where google
        tested their cars. </p>

<p class="summary">The purpose of these driver-less cars is to eliminate traffic injuries and deaths caused by
human error, save time, money, and land for parking. The cars that google makes their prototypes
out of are Lexus and Toyota. They pilot themselves using sophisticated sensors, software and onboard 
computers.</p>

<p class="summary">These cars are tested on a 2000- acre research facility which is on federal property. This way 
there is no worry about California regulations that state a human back-up driver must be in the car
during testing on public roads. As well, a new regulation was added that requires these cars to have
manual controls when tested on public roads. So a temporary steering wheel and pedals were added. </p>

<p class="summary">In the next phase of these tests the goal is to have a driver on board who can take control of the 
car if necessary. If that goes well then their plan is to test the cars in a more autonomous mode 
without a back-up drive at all. 
</p>
<p class="summary">If these tests go well and self driving cars are released to the public it would defiantly make
a change in our lives. The question is, for the better, or for the worse?</p>
