        <p class="summary">The Google Self-Driving Car is a project by Google that involves developing technology for autonomous cars. 
            The software powering Google's cars is called Google Chauffeur. Lettering on the side of each car identifies 
            it as a "self-driving car". The project is currently being led by Google engineer Sebastian Thrun, former director
            of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and co-inventor of Google Street View. Thrun's team at
            Stanford created the robotic vehicle Stanley which won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge and its US$2 million prize 
            from the United States Department of Defense. The team developing the system consisted of 15 engineers 
            working for Google, including Chris Urmson, Mike Montemerlo, and Anthony Levandowski who had worked on the DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges.</p>

<p class="summary">Legislation has been passed in four states and the District of Columbia allowing driverless cars. 
The U.S. state of Nevada passed a law on June 29, 2011, permitting the operation of autonomous 
cars in Nevada, after Google had been lobbying in that state for robotic car laws. The Nevada
law went into effect on March 1, 2012, and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles issued the first 
license for an autonomous car in May 2012, to a Toyota Prius modified with Google's experimental 
driverless technology. In April 2012, Florida became the second state to allow the testing of 
autonomous cars on public roads, and California became the third when Governor Jerry Brown
signed the bill into law at Google HQ in Mountain View. In July 2014, the city of 
Coeur d'Alene, Idaho adopted a robotics ordinance that includes provisions to allow for 
self-driving cars.</p>

<p class="summary">On May 28, 2014, Google presented a new prototype of their driverless car that had
neither a steering wheel nor pedals.</p>
